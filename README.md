The Online Shop app UI consists of two pages: one for the product page, featuring a horizontal list of categories followed by a list of our products; and the details page, displaying the price, short description, and Buy Now button. One of the most noteworthy features of the Online Shop app is that each product comes in its own unique color, enhancing its visual appeal.
